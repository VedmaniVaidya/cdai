1. An abstract method is a method with only declaration and no definition. Write keyword "abstract" in the method declaration.
2. An abstract method can be written only inside abstract class however, an abstract can have abstract as well as concrete methods.
3. We can't instantiate the abstract class. i.e can't create an object of abstract class.
4. For any class it is mandatory to override all the abstract methods of its superclass else, we need to declare subclass also an abstract class.
5. If all the methods of a class are abstract then, declare it as an interface rather than, an abstract class.
6. All the methods of interface are by default abstract.
7. A class can't be extended from multiple super classes (multiple inheritance is not supported) however, it can be implement multiple interface.
8. One interface can extended other interfaces(s).
9. Marker interface - An interface which do not have method declared inside that e.g. Serializalble, Cloneable.
10. Functional interface- An interface which has only one method declared inside it. e.g Consumer, Predicate, Runnable.
